# What are Blendables?

Blendables are Post Process materials that add custom Post Process Effect to your overall scene. Blendables are usually added in a Post Process Volume Actor, in the PostProcessMaterials array. Multiple Blendables can be added and given different weightage between 0 and 1 to combine their effects accordingly.
