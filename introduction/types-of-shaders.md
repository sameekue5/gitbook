# Types of Shaders

The Shaders can be differentiated into three types, based on the type of environment it affects.



* The **MainShaders** affect objects at a navigable distance, i.e not very far away from you.
* The **BackgroundShaders** affect background objects, like Sky and Atmosphere.
* The **CommonShaders** affect the entire scene.
